Defined quantities in protocol.h must match your telescope.  Look
for

#define ALTCOUNTPERDEG 46603.3778      
#define AZCOUNTPERDEG  46603.3778

and modify as needed.  Values for the C11 CGE the C11 GPS fork mounts may
be provided in subsequent release.

The files in this directory support the use of the auxilliary command set of 
the NexStar system, accessed through the RJ-11 serial port on the hand paddle.

These commands do not rely on the software in the handcontroller for
calculation of RA and Dec.  When this driver is in use you will be able to use
the hand control NSEW buttons, but you will not have access to RA and Dec from
the hand control display.

WARNING:  Some of the software protections for limits and cordwrap available
through the handcontrol interface after a normal manual startup will not be
functional when this driver is in use.  You must provide other means of
protecting your hardware from unintentional mechanical damage when you use this
driver.  This is particularly crucial for remote or unattended operation.

Our recommendation is that this driver only be used in combination with
limit switches which turn off power to the telescope if it should track or slew
into an unwanted configuration, or at a minimum, with visual confirmation that
it is performing normally, and easy access to a "kill" switch.

Please see the manual for additional information and for suggestions on how to
add limit switches to a mounting.
