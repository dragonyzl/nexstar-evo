This code is included only for reference and it will not work with the current
version of xmtel.  See nexstar/aux for the up-to-date structure.

The difference between the PC and AUX verions is in the communication with the
microcontrollers in the mount. The AUX version uses the serial buffers of the
hand control, and the PC version goes directly  to the mirocontroller serial
network.  

Unfortunately many Celestron mounts with a "PC" connection are very sensitive to
pickup on the serial lines, and do not function reliably when any connection is
made to the PC port.  The hand control's serial input buffers the serial lines
from the computer and insures noise immunity.
