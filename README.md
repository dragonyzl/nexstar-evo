# nexstar-evo

Routines for Celestron NexStar Evolution telescopes.

For now this is only testing code and docs. It may grow into full indi driver for wifi control of the scope in the future. Depending on the completness of the docs and required effort. 

The docs are in the docs dir (duh!).
The progress in decoding the communication and structure of the scope is described in the [notes.md](doc/notes.md) file.
The code will land in nsevo directory. The analysis contains some communication dumps and extracts.

Contributions are welcome!
